# Ackermann Autonomous Vehicle (ROS 2)

This project is a ROS 2-based Ackermann-steered autonomous ground vehicle capable of performing real-time SLAM and autonomous navigation in dynamic environments. It integrates ROS 2 Control for hardware interface, SLAM Toolbox for mapping and localization, and Nav2 for path planning and obstacle avoidance.
